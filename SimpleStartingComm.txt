# importing can be done by two types 
import numpy as np  -----> importing the whole library
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import ensemble,metrics  -----> importing parts of a library, metrics used for score function and performance calculation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  -----> used to split data for test and train

# reading from files
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv', sep=',')  -----> reading from csv

# certain manipulation commands
data.head()  -----> often used to read from data in notebook(gives first five columns)
data.describe()  -----> simply describes the data in hand, tells us about the general characteristics of the data
y = data[['Y']]  -----> used to select one column from the data
X = data.drop('Y', axis=1)  -----> used to select all the columns except one
X = data.drop(['a', 'b'], axis=1)  -----> used to drop more than one column
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.3,random_state=4)  -----> creating test and train data
